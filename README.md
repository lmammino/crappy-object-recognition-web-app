## Crappy object recognition web app

A crappy but solid (because, of course, it uses [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/)) web app that uses your device camera and [tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) to try to recognise objects in your scene.

## Get started

If you have a recent version of Node.js installed, clone this repo and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This should start the app locally (most likely on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)).
